/* A program which takes an input file of dictionary of words separated by newline characters
 * and concurrently selects the words in the file that are palindromes, or
 * words where their reverse appear in the wordlist somewhere. Input dictionary should be located in
 * ./dictionary/words and the palindromic words will be printed to ./dictionary/palindromes.
 * 
 * Compile: g++ palindromes.cpp -fopenmp -o -palindromes
 * Usage: ./palindromes #NUM_THREADS
 * View palindromic words: cat dictionary/palindromes
