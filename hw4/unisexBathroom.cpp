/* A program which attempts to solve the unisex bathroom problem in a fair way. Given x and y workers of male and female genders, can we
 * coordinate their access to a single bathroom so that men and women never use the bathroom at the same time, and so that a person waiting
 * in line is guaranteed to be allowed to use the bathroom eventually? A worker is represented by a Posix Thread, and work time is represented
 * by sleeping a random amount of time. Bathroom use is represented by sleeping a smaller random amount of time. All synchronization is
 * accomplished using a monitor which is implemented with 4 counters, 2 condition variables, and a mutex lock
 *
 * Compile: There is a script provided, ./makeFile, which compiles this and the monitor program into ./unisexBathroom.
 * Execute: ./unisexBathroom numMen numWomen
 * For a more verbose updating of events, define DEBUG to 1
 * If no args are given, the program will be run with 1000 men and 1000 women
